### About product

Correction of a dehydrated state is accomplished by the replenishment of necessary water and electrolytes (through oral rehydration therapy or fluid replacement by intravenous therapy. As oral rehydration is less painful, less invasive, less expensive, and easier to provide, it is the treatment of choice for mild dehydration. Solutions used for intravenous rehydration must be isotonic or hypertonic. Pure water injected into the veins will cause the breakdown (lysis) of red blood cells (erythrocytes).

### How to use
Dissolve one sachet of ORS in one-liter clean water. Do not boil the solution or mix anything. Use the solution within 24 hours.
- **Infants:** One liter over 24 hours’ period 
- **Children:** One liter over 8 to 24 hours’ period.
- **Adults:** Drink freely as required (Two to four liters during 24 hours).

### About Product:

Allergy occurs when a person's immune system reacts to substances in the environment that are harmless for most people. These substances are known as allergens. Allergens are found in dust mites, pets, pollen, insects, ticks, molds, foods and some medicines. 

Allergy shots help your body get used to allergens, the things that trigger an allergic reaction. It'll contain a tiny amount of the thing you’re allergic to like pollen, pet dander, mold, dust, or bee venom, for example. By using small amounts of allergens, the human immune system gets used to the allergens that cause the reactions. So within a few months the patients have less symptoms and within a few years may no longer suffer from an allergy.

### How to use:

### Dosage:
The dose will go up gradually until you get to what’s called a maintenance dose. After that, you’ll usually get a shot every 2-4 weeks for 4-5 months. Then your doctor will gradually increase the time between shots until you’re getting them about once a month for 3-5 years. During that time, your allergy symptoms will get better and may even go away.
