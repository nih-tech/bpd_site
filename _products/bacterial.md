Cyanee nec pedicis positi. Esse et diem forte quoque et ieiunia
vixque dixit negari _ullis stamina_: trahit. Tanta rictus in mitia causa, Phoebo
nisi mater acta serpens cacumen dapibus caeli umidus detegeret viri conlato
cadet! [Ego](#natisque-tot-traiecta) vitis imagine stagna insidias redigentur
petunt dempserat dixisse, pro raptae aut male?

![Tetanus Toxoid Mix Vaccine](/images/products/tetanus-toxoid-mix-vaccine.png)

### About product

Tetanus is caused by the action of C/ostr1diumtelani toxin upon the central nervous system. The toxin increases reflex stimulation of the motor neurons by functional blockade of the inhibitory neurons. This leads to the typicaltelanus symptoms of rigidity and reflex spasms. For active immunization,the tetanus toxin is converted into a non-toxic toxoid which remains fully effective as an antigen.The active potential is increased by adsorption onto an aluminium adjuvant.

### How to use:

Three doses of 0.5ml each, the first two doses are to be given 4-8 weeks apart with a third dose 6 to 12 months later. To maintain the level of immunity, further 0.5ml booster dose is recommended every 5 to 10 years. 
Tetanus Prophylaxis In Case of Injury:
