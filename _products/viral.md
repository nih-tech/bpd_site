## PakVac

PakVac vaccine is Ad5-nCoV recombinant vaccine which is being manufactured at NIH with the help of Cansino bio from China. This joint venture began when NIH and a local pharma company AJM pharma joined hands with the Cansino bio to launch the phase III clinical trials of this vaccine in late 2020. The CanSino vaccine operates by injecting antibodies that the immune system then uses to protect against further invasions. The vaccine provides maximum protection after two shots.
